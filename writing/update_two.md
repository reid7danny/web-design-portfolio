# Status Update by Daniel Reid

Please follow the instructions in the assignment sheet as you write a
status update for the web design portfolio. This update should have two
paragraphs inside of it, with one paragraph explaining what you have already
implemented and the other the plan that you will follow to complete the
project.

I am progressing in my software portfolio project. I have implemented not only the outline code to help format my website, but included an introductory paragraph and link section to help beginning chefs. I also tried to deploy my site to Netlify, but was unsuccessful. Luckily, this issue was addressed in my latest office hour meeting with Professor Kapfhammer who explained that I need to specify certain pieces of the site for the build command to be executed correctly. I have also continued to research forms and figure out a feasible way that I can create a form that people can upload recipes to, which could be accessed by other users. Although manually updating the website would be easy, it would also require a lot of maintenance on my end, so I am looking for easier routes to address this.

I still need to continue adding code to the site and images as well. I tried to incorporate an image into my site, but was not successful. I think there is a problem with the reference, which I am continuing to investigate. I also still need to do more research for the tips section of the site and I am going to try and implement a site which has multiple pages to it.

Overall, I still feel like I am on track to complete the portfolio project on time.
