# Status Update by Danny Reid

Please follow the instructions in the assignment sheet as you write a status
update for the web design portfolio. This update should have two paragraphs
inside of it, with one paragraph explaining what you have already implemented
and the other the plan that you will follow to complete the project.

So far, the web design portfolio project is going well. I have implemented outline code, which breaks the webpage into different sections. I have designated a space for links and other useful materials. I have also done some research into cooking sites and beginner tips, so implementing them will not be difficult. Further, I have included an image to view how it will appear in the webpage.

I do still have work to do left. I want to create separate pages that users can be directed to, when accessing the website. Further, I plan on changing the format and fonts through a css file. Overall though, I have no concerns with being able to complete this project on time.

Unrelated, I have also scheduled an office hour appointment to get the project approved by Professor Kapfhammer.
