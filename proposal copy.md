## Cooking Website

## Abstract

My project is going to be a cooking oriented website which will utilize forms and other links to provide information and tips on how to cook and what to make.

## Main Idea

I would like to create a cooking website that people can upload recipes and other cooking related tips to. I think that this is something that is useful because many people like to cook. I think that a section of my website would also include basic cooking techniques that would help beginners. Cooking is something that is universal and has the power to bring people together, which is something that is really important - especially in today's current climate.

## Listing of Tasks

- Find helpful links for cooking tips
- Research easy, medium and difficult meals to make
- Connect some type of form to the website to allow users to give feedback or enter recipes/tips on their own
- Code the actual website
- Set up fonts and CSS files

## Plan for Completing the Work

I plan on completing all of the aforementioned tasks by using good time management skills and seeking out help when necessary. I think that I have gotten some good experience from the last 6 labs, so I think that I should not have much trouble.
