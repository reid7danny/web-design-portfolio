<h3> Some people might say that good cooking is something that is not relevant in today's current climate. </h3>
That there are more important things to worry about than learning how to cook. <br>
That cooking is only for some people.
<br>
<h3>I disagree.</h3>
Food is a powerful driver of community building. Many people appreciate a good homemade meal,
and good food can even repair relationships, spark conversation and provide a sense of family. <br>
<br>
Therefore, there is no better time than in today's current climate to learn how to cook. <br>
Our country, our states, our communities, often find themselves divided, when we most need to come together. <br>
Food can bring people together, and I hope that this website can help with that.
